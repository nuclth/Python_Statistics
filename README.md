**OPEN ISSUE**: Not all MathJax equations are rendered correctly when viewing Jupyter notebooks directly on github. To correct this download the notebooks and open them using ```jupyter notebook filename``` where ```filename``` is the name of the notebook. Alternatively, use the links above to view them online using the nbviewer hosted at jupyter.org.
